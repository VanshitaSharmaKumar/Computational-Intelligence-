# Computational-Intelligence-
The following topics are expected background knowledge. In most cases, a little understanding goes a long way. 

Calculus
Linear Algebra
Statistics & Probability Theory
Machine Learning
Programming (Python)

Aim of the course: VU study guide definition: 
In the course Computational Intelligence, we will focus mainly on
computational aspects of Artificial Intelligence, namely, optimization
algorithms for solving learning problems. Specifically, we will consider
problems that cannot be solved using information about gradient due to
their combinatorial character or complexity of the objective function
(e.g., non-differentiability, blackbox objective function)
